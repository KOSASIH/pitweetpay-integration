# Architecture Overview

This document provides an overview of the architecture of our system, including the components, interactions, and technologies used.

## Components

- Frontend
- Built using React and TypeScript
- Responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user input
- Communicates with the backend API to retrieve and send data

## Backend API

- Built using Django and Python
- Responsible for handling business logic, data storage, and retrieval
- Exposes a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with

## Database

- Built using PostgreSQL
- Responsible for storing and retrieving data
- Interacts with the backend API to store and retrieve data

## Message Queue

- Built using RabbitMQ
- Responsible for handling asynchronous tasks and message passing between components
- Interacts with the backend API to send and receive messages

## Interactions

### User Interaction

- The user interacts with the frontend, which sends requests to the backend API
- The backend API processes the requests and returns responses to the frontend
- The frontend renders the responses to the user

### API Interaction

- The frontend sends requests to the backend API to retrieve or send data
- The backend API processes the requests and returns responses to the frontend
- The frontend renders the responses to the user

### Database Interaction

- The backend API interacts with the database to store and retrieve data
- The database stores and retrieves data as requested by the backend API

### Message Queue Interaction

- The backend API sends messages to the message queue to handle asynchronous tasks
- The message queue processes the messages and sends responses to the backend API
- The backend API processes the responses and returns results to the frontend

### Technologies

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Webpack
- Backend API: Django, Python, PostgreSQL
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ
